# Portofilo-landing-Page
My portfolio landing page, built with GSAP and ScrollTrigger, delivers smooth, interactive animations inspired by Sheriyans Coding School. Elements fade, slide, and scale with scroll, creating an engaging storytelling flow that showcases my skills, projects, and creativity in a modern, responsive design.
This is my interactive portfolio landing page project, created as a learning and practice exercise after following tutorials from @Sheriyans Coding School. The page is designed with smooth animations, scroll effects, and modern UI/UX styling to showcase my creativity and skills in front-end development.
